                paragraphs of text. Use the HTML tags &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;/h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; in this exercise. As the texts in the
                heading and paragraphs you can use any texts you like. <br>
                <ul id="ul1" style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>Add an unordered list to this web page. An unordered list should look like the following when
                        it is shown by a browser:<br>
                        <ul id="ul2">
                            <li>An unordered list can be specified with the tags &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;/ul&gt;.</li>
                            <li>An unordered list typically contains a number of list items that can be specified
                                with tags &lt;li&gt; and &lt;/li&gt;.</li>
                            <li>After you have created your unordered list, check out what happens when you
                                convert it to an ordered list by replacing the tags &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;/ul&gt; with &lt;ol&gt; and
                                &lt;/ol&gt;, respectively.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>Add an image to your web page. In this exercise you must use the <img> tag. As an image, you
                        can use any .jpg or .png file you find on the Internet.</li>
                </ul>

            </li></div></a>
            <a href="#" target="_blank"><div id="ques7"><li>Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs. You could name this new
                file another_page.html, and you should place it into the same folder where your first .html is. After
                you have created the new .html page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load
                another_page.html when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. You need to use the
                &lt;a&gt; and &lt;/a&gt; tags in this exercise. Inside the tag &lt;a&gt; you need to use a href attribute that specifies
                which page will be loaded when the link is clicked.</li></div></a>
            <a href="#" target="_blank" title="This leads you to another page"><div id="ques8"><li>HTML tags like &lt;a&gt; can have certain attributes. The href attribute is mandatory in the &lt;a&gt; tag.
                Additionally it is possible to use the title attribute which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse
                cursor is moved above a link. This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in
                the previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when the mouse cursor is
                over the link.</li></div></a>
            <a href="task9.html" target="_blank"><div id="ques9"><li>It is possible to use a picture (image) as a link. Modify your page so that the picture that is on your
                page will also serve as a link that leads to another page.</li></div></a>
            <a href="#" target="_blank"><div id="ques10"><li>Upload your two .html files to a server and test that they work as real internet pages.</li></div></a>

                        and so on). Each Course entry in the list should be a HTML link that leads to a web-page
                        totally dedicated to the course itself.</li>
                    <li>Each Course should have its own dedicated web-page. This page should contain a description

                        subject.</li>
                    <li>The Admission page basically contains a form that a student needs to fill up in order to take
                        admission in the college. The form should ask all the necessary questions using appropriate
